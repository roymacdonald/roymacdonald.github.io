<h1>Music</h1>

Music is one of the things I like the most of all.
Yet, I'm not a very good musician, even though I've struggled a lot to be able to play guitar decently enough. On the other side I feel very comfortable with machines and knobs, taking me to produce serval records for different bands/projects. Music production places me in a very similar position as the one I usually take when dealing with visual arts or commissioned/commercial jobs; the one in between the artistic side of things and the technical ones, allowing fluent communication between these, directing the artistic decisions as well as making sure that the technical ones are always taken to according to the artistic direction.<br />
I am a founding member of the online record label <a href="http://www.uvarobot.cl">Uva Robot</a> through which several of these recordings have been published.<br />
