#Nestlé's Estrellitas Cereal Kinect Game

We were commisioned to develop a game using the Microsoft Kinect sensor for an AD campaing of Nestlé's Estrellitas Cereal.
As far as I understand this was the first use of the Kinect Sensor in an AD campaing in Chile.

By detecting arm gestures, the user had to free a spaceship trapped by space debris, by throwing tiny stars (Estrellitas) towards it.

I developed this work while I was still working at Macrobio (I was one of the owners/partners, lead developer and project director).
