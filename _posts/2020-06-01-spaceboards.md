During the 2020 pandemic I helped [Agnes Chavez](https://agneschavez.com/) to envision and develop the Space Boards platform, which eventually became a larger project called [Space Messengers](https://agneschavez.com/portfolio/space-messengers/) project.

How to gather messages from kids at different schools, in different places, that were attending a workshop- while making it fun, engaging and allowing them to interact between them? 

This was the challenge that Agnes had. Through several brainstorming and ideation sessions we ended up with the idea of having a platform with "boards" where kids could leave their messages in an interactive and collaborative way at realtime in an "open-canvas" style. At the same time give them the chance to chat with each other. 

I ended up developing this whole platform using ReactJS and Firebase. 
This platform became the backbone of Agnes' workshops about art, science and technology.

The messages collected from the workshops were eventually used for the [spacemessengers show](https://www.spacemessengers.com/)
