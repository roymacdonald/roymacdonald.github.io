#New York City is flat... almost

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/143779655?portrait=0" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>Made using openFrameworks<br /> code and MacOSX app available at https://github.com/roymacdonald/flatCity</p>

<span style="font-family:serif;font-size:2.5em;line-height:0.9">This city seems to be flat.  
Its small hills became irrelevant  
sided by gigantic buldings.</span>

<span style="font-family:serif;font-size:2.5em;line-height:0.9">With motorized vehicles  
this hills and slopes pass unnoticed  
by walking it's just a few blocks  
so there's no overall picture.</span>

<span style="font-family:serif;font-size:2.5em;line-height:0.9">Only when cycling through the city  
you can feel even the slightest slope.</span>
