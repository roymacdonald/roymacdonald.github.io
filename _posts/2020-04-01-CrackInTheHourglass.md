I developed all the front-end, backend and API for Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's artwork A crack in the Hourglass.
The following is the description of such artwork.

*“A Crack in the Hourglass” is a transitory “anti-monument” in response to the pandemic and the ways it has halted public rituals of mourning. In this participatory artwork, a modified robotic plotter deposits grains of hourglass sand onto a black surface to recreate the images of those lost due to COVID-19. After each portrait is completed, the surface tilts and the same sand is recycled into the next portrait, echoing the collective and ongoing nature of the pandemic.*


The website was the main interface through which the participants interacted with the work. In it they would be able to submit images of their beloved ones that had passed away because of COVID19. This image was stored , preprocessed and made available to the software running the sand plotter. The site was multilingual. The users would get an email notification when their image would start to get plotted. All the plotted images would be made available on the website in a gallery.
