Android app developed for the LG Optimus G at Lollapalooza Chile 2013.
This app used the phones sensors (gyro, compass, accelerometer) to determine where it was pointing to allowing the user to paint over a big LCD monitor. The phone's touch interface allowed to witch between different brush styles and colors.
