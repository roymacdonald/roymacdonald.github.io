Generative laser projection mapped onto roundabout in Santiago de Chile. The drawings were generated by tracking the flow of cars through the use of computer vision. This urban light intervention was part of the [KuzeFest Lights Festival of Santiago 2017](http://www.kuzefest.cl/en.html).
This was presented on the closing ceremony/party of the festival that took place at an art gallery that overviewed this roundabout.

This was made using a laser projector, which is just a powerful laser bounced of 2 mirrors that oscilate very fast, thus moving the laser beam to create the illusion of a line. 
I developed a custom openFrameworks application to control the laser beam and track the cars. The video feed from a camera that was overlooking the whole roundabout was used to track the cars lights. The drawing was generated based on all the tracked points, which was then sent to the laser projector through a special interfase.

A lot of artifacts were introduced due to how this kind of laser projectors works. The compexity of what is being drawn is limited by the oscilations of the mirrors. When more complex shapes are drawn the "refresh rate" or "scan line" becomes visible. Forcing the projector to draw sharp corners limits this even further; the projector interpreted corners as smooth curves, naturaly interpolating the sides of the corner. As I ended liking this artifacts, which produced more "natural" shapes and introduced a lot of uncertainty, I decided to keep these. I think of these as the projector's "contribution" to the project.

I got invited to this lights festival and told to make something at its closure event. It was going to happen at an art gallery on the top of a building overlooking Plaza Baquedano (usually mislabeled as Plaza Italia), which is located in the most important avenue/axis of the city and it is usually refered as the point that divides the city between upper and lower social classes. This two aspects of the location are the pivots of this work.
