While visiting CERN I helped artist Agnes Chavez to envision, conceptualize and develop an artwork centered around Neutrino detectors and quantum physics.

She wanted to work with AR but was not clear on how to make 3d ojects that encapsulated her vision. A generative system seemed to be the best approach but generative 3d in AR did not seem to be something anyone else was doing. Although my experience, knowledge about available tools and intuition made me go for it and develop a generative AR platform.

Since I understand a good amount about particle physics it was not hard for me to understand and abstract a lot of the concepts in it.

The generative system "depicts" a cloud of probabilities and the wave function collapse. When triggered will show a cone of light as the one from the Cherenkov effect, the very same one that happens in neutrino detectors when a neutrino interacts with other other particles and it is captured by the super sensitive light multipliers inside the detector.

We needed a lightweight app as mobile phones were the intended devices to use. We chose to use simple lines and points rather than complicated or expensive rendering, which matched Agnes' "hand drawn" lines style she was aiming for.

When an user taps its screen, they trigger a wave function collapse. Their position in space is recorded and shown to all the rest of the participants.

As any generative system, this one too depended on many parameters that could be tweaked and that could jave some really radical differences in the looks, this parameters are not available to end users on their mobiles, but still needed to be tweaked by Agnes so she could get the looks that she liked.
