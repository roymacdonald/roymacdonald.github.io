Remote audio addon for Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's Border Tuner artwork.

As Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's studio uses a lot the audio addon I made for openFrameworks - [ofxSoundObjects](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxSoundObjects); they asked me to develop another addon, compatible with ofxSoundObjects that would send and receive audio to remote computers within a local area network (LAN). Very creatively named [ofxSoundObjects-NDI](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxSoundObjects-NDI)
We chose to use NDI as the backbone of it.
It was used for Border Tuner.

It worked remarkably well, considering that the local network consisted of several stations each a few kilometers from each other all connected through Wi-Fi as it was not possible to make it wired.

This addon I develop is opensourced and you can find it [here](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxSoundObjects-NDI)
