##Assignment for Concept & Theory Class [Taeyoon Choi]

####Exhibition curation:

This exhibition would consist on artwork sent by mail by artists around the world. Artists should be SFPC students, alumni, teachers or fellows.
The artworks to be submitted should be focused towards presenting to the audience the point of view of the artist [or the artwork] and somehow taking them into experiencing a different point of view of something else hopefully in real time and/or using technology and any kind of media. All the artwork should be sent by mail.

####Purpose
Each individual has its own perspective and point of view of the world, thus its path and journey through space, time and life is unique. Trying to put someone else in the point of view of another is usually quite hard as it involves having one to abstract from its own POV and place into someone else's that must be transmitted somehow. The idea behind this exhibition is to

####Artwork packaging

The packaging of artwork must be part of the artwork itself. It must be capable of withstanding the shipping processes in order to arrive in good conditions to the exhibition space.
It must be capable of self deploying or using really simple instructions to be performed by any person. Actually there wont be any specially assigned person on assisting the unboxing and deployment of each package. It will have to rely on  the "good will" of the audience if assistance is needed. If any hazardous process is needed to be perform it must be warned hysterically to the audience. Dangerous and harmful artwork is encouraged!.

Each art piece will be assigned a special space in either a shared or individual room.
