INVOCACIÓN , light concert. This is a live music performance, which takes elements from ambient, drone and noise music. The lights are "performed" live as well both by manual tinkering and using sound reactive parameters.

This piece was developed as a colaborative piece with [**Trimex Collective**](http://trimex.cl/), which is formed by  **Juan José Aldunce, Andrés Terrisse y Roy Macdonald.**.

Direction, live performance, music, concept, art direction, setup design, coding and development made by Trimex Collective.
