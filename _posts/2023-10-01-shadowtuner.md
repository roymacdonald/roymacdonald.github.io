Installation where you could tune any radio in the world using your body. 

Part of the larger installation called Translation Island in Abu Dhabi.

A massive inflatable sphere with the world map projected on it shows all the radio stations in the world. When the users "shadow" was over one of these stations it would get tuned so they could listen to it; by moving around the user becomes the radio dial.

I developed a system that was able to tune any of radiostations and smoothly crossfade into the next one. A smart and sofisticated pre-buffering system allowed for the smooth, and really satisfying , switching between stations. 

The visuals and video mapping was developed by Antimodular's Hugo Daoust.
