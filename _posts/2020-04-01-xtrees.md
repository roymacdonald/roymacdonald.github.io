I made the 5th version of the software for [Agnes Chavez' (x)trees](https://agneschavez.com/portfolio/xtrees/)

> (x)trees is a dynamically generating forest of trees created from SMS and Tweets from the audience in real time. It is projected in real time on to buildings and large spaces, exploring our relationship to nature and technology.  (x)trees tours around the world creating a participatory experience to raise awareness to ecological topics such as deforestation and climate change. By integrating data mining from SMS and social networks, people participate in the creation of the branches to form a virtual interactive forest of dynamically generating trees. The audience sends a tweet or text message and sees their message appear on the wall with a branch.

I developed the 5th iteration of this software. The previous project was made using a quite old version of [openFrameworks](openframeworks.cc) and a lot of its dependencies were outdated or deprecated. Besides updating I added some new functionalities that made it easier to setup and change parameters along with support for SMS and Twitter messages.

The source code for it is available [here](https://github.com/AgnesChavez/XTrees_2020)
