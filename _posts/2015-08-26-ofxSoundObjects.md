# [ofxSoundObjects](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxSoundObjects/)

## Simple yet super powerful modular sound architecture for [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).
It allows to connect any sound source, process, display and output it in any way needed. It is capable of reading and writing audio files. 

This is an addon version for the ofSoundObject implementation originally conceived at the 2013 OFDev Conference held at the Yamaguchi Center For Arts and Media, Japan.
The developers involved in this were:

* [Adam Carlucci](https://github.com/admsyn/)
* [Marek Bareza](https://github.com/mazbox)
* [Arturo Castro](https://github.com/arturoc)
* [Roy Macdonald](https://github.com/roymacdonald/)


The original development branch can be found [here](https://github.com/admsyn/openFrameworks/tree/feature-sound-objects).

Made as addon, improoved and updated by Roy Macdonald.
