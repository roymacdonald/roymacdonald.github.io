Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's Dune Ringers was the follow-up to [Summon](./work/2022/07/01/summon.html)

Part of the larger installation called Translation Island in Abu Dhabi.

A good amount of the software developed for Summon was reused here but in this case we had a large scale video mapping over some sand dunes.
