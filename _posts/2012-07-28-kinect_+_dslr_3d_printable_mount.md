# Kinect + DSLR 3D printable mount

This 3D printable piece is for putting together a DSLR camera and a Kinect and keep these aligned.
I made it to use it with the RGBD Toolkit. Soon it became the official RGBD Toolkit 3D printable mount and remained as such for a long time until newer versions appeared.
You still can download the 3D model from [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27510) and print it.
