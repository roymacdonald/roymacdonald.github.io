> Space Messengers is an Immersive Mixed Reality installation and international youth exchange exploring the universe through art, science and technology.

In order to show at an exhibition the messages collected with [SpaceBoards](/work/2020/10/01/spaceboards.html) I developed a visualization system inspired by [(x)trees](/work/2020/10/01/xtrees.html) that showed the messages floating and dispersing around the projection space.
This system also was able to receive realtime messages sent via whatsapp, SMS and from a dedicated website chat and show these.

This visualizations were overlayed on top of the very colorful and fun interactive visuals developed by [Omai](https://www.omai.at/).

In order to adjust all the different settings of the visualization system I developed a companion iPad app to control the settings. It  made the whole setup process a lot easier as Agnes would like to move around and set it up her self.
